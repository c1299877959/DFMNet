DFMM: Depth Feature Modulation Module for Crowd Counting

This repository contains the official implementation of DFMM, a lightweight and effective module for improving crowd counting performance.
DFMM is designed to adapt to various backbones and enhances both counting accuracy and cross-modal fusion quality (RGB + Depth).

🚀 Features

🔧 Plug-and-Play: Easily integrates with different backbones (ResNet, CSRNet, etc.).

📊 Consistent Accuracy Gains: Improves counting accuracy across multiple datasets.

🌐 Cross-Modal Fusion: Enhances RGB-D crowd counting by effective feature integration.

⚡ Efficient: Reduces GFLOPs while maintaining or improving accuracy.
